    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoon olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 (3 lb) chuck roast</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 medium yellow onion, peeled, halved and cut into thick slices</li>
        <li>5 garlic cloves, minced (1 1/2 tablespoon)</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cup beef broth</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>2 1/2 lbs small yukon gold potatoes, left whole</li>
        <li>5 medium carrots (about 1 lb), peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch mixed with 3 tablespoons beef broth, optional, for thickening gravy</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 Tbsp olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat.
            <br>Dab roast dry with paper towels, season all over
            with salt <br>and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Sear roast in pot until browned on both sides, about 4 - 5
            <br>minutes per side. Transfer roast to slow cooker.
        </li>
        <li>Add remaining 1/2 Tbsp olive oil to pot. Add onion and
            <br>saute 2 minutes, add garlic and saute 30 seconds
            longer. <br>Pour onion mixture over roast in slow cooker.
        </li>
        <li>Return pot to heat, pour in beef broth, Worcestershire,
            <br>thyme and rosemary and cook about 15 seconds, just
            long <br>enough to scrape up browned bits from the bottom
            of the <br>pot. Remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li>Layer potatoes and carrots over onion layer in slow cooker,
            <br>pour beef broth evenly over top then season with
            salt and <br>pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Cover slow cooker and cook on low heat until roast and
            <br>vegetables are tender, about 8 - 9 hours.
        </li>
        <li>Remove roast and vegetables, shred roast (discard fat) and
            <br>cut potatoes if desired.
        </li>
        <li>If you'd like to thicken the broth and make a gravy, pour
            <br>broth from slow cooker through a fine mesh
            strainer into a <br>small saucepan. Heat over medium-high heat.
            Whisk <br>cornstarch with 3 Tbsp beef broth then
            pour into saucepan. <br>Bring to a simmer, stirring constantly,
            let simmer 30 - 60 <br>seconds.
        </li>
        <li> Plate roast and vegetables, pour gravy over the top and
            <br>sprinkle with parsley.
        </li>
    </ol>
